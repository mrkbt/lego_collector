# Lego Collector
Basic webscraping script that takes a list of LEGO set id numbers (currently from the _sets_YEAR.csv_ files) and downloads the set information from [brickset.com](http://brickset.com/) together with the set price data from [bricklink.com](http://bricklink.com/). Information and price data are stored in two separate .csv files linked with a common _set_id-variant_ identifier.
